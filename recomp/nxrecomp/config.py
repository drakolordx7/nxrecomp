"""The per-game configuration seam.

Everything game-specific that the generic lifter must not know lives in a `GameConfig` subclass under
recomp/games/<name>/config.py (and is selected with --game <name>). smo-recomp kept this knowledge inside its
lifter (sdklift_rules.txt, "nerve" RTTI naming, NPDM / version checks, base-to-update symbol matching); here the
lifter only asks the config. The default config is a neutral one that lifts a module as it is.
