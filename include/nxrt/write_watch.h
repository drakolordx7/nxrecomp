// Page write tracking of guest memory (S38). The owner of a region "arms" pages: they become read-only for the CPU, and the first
// write to one of them faults; a vectored exception handler makes the page writable again, marks it written and lets the write go on.
// The owner (the NVN back end keeps device-local copies of pool pages, nvn_gpu_pool.cpp) then knows which pages changed without reading
// them. Only the CPU's view is protected: the GPU reaches the same physical pages through its own import and never faults.
//
// Limits, all handled here or by the callers named:
//  * Regions lie in the heap's primary view (mem::kHeapBase). A page the guest can also reach through an alias view (svcMapMemory and
//    friends, mem::heap_alias) is banned: a write through the alias would not fault. memory.cpp calls forget() for every change of
//    mapping or protection it makes, so an armed page never ends up with a protection somebody else chose.
//  * Writes by the operating system into guest memory (ReadFile into a buffer) do not raise an exception: the call fails instead. The file
//    readers call before_os_write() on the destination first (services/fs_*.cpp).
//  * Granularity is the 4 KiB page.
