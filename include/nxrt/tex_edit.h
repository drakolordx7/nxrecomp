// Texture pixel edit (S45): lets the host change the pixels of game textures that are ASTC in the game and become BC7 (or RGBA8) on the PC,
// whole mip chains included. Used by the suit and arm cannon colour tweak (games/mpr/mpr_tint.cpp). Unlike tex_override.h (small BC7 UI icons,
// replaced as a whole), the host sees each level of the game's own image as RGBA8 and edits it in place; the runtime re-encodes it.
//
// How it runs (src/gfx/nvn/nvn_tex_edit.cpp):
//   * prepare_texture asks `match` for every 2D ASTC texture (one layer) it prepares; a non-zero answer is the host's id of that texture.
//   * The edited data is made once per (texture content, generation) and kept in memory, so uploading the same texture again costs a copy. It never
//     goes into the BC7 disk cache, which stays the game's own look.
//   * texture_edit_changed (after the host's answers changed, e.g. a new colour): a worker thread makes the new data of every live texture that
//     matches (or was edited before) and only then asks for those textures to be uploaded again, so the render thread does not wait for the encode.
// All callbacks may run on any thread (render thread, background texture jobs, the worker) and must be thread safe.
