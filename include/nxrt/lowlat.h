//
// One frame of the game crosses three threads: the guest main thread (Update: pacing, input sampling, simulation), the host render thread
// that replays the game's command lists and presents, and the driver. The markers follow that:
//
//   main thread    sim_begin()        sleeps (Reflex vkLatencySleepNV / Anti-Lag INPUT stage) so the frame starts as late as the GPU allows, then
//                                     SIMULATION_START; input_sample() sets INPUT_SAMPLE just before the mouse and pad are read; sim_end()
//   render thread  submit_begin()     RENDERSUBMIT_START at the first replayed submission of the frame
//                  present_begin()    RENDERSUBMIT_END, PRESENT_START, returns the present id to pass in VkPresentIdKHR
//                  present_end()      PRESENT_END
//
// Frame ids pair the threads: a frame leaves sim_end() into a queue and the next present takes the oldest id, so a frame keeps its id from
// simulation to present however many frames the render thread lags. All calls are no-ops when the mode is off or the GPU has neither
// extension, and every entry point is safe to call from any thread.
