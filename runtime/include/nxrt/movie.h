// Host implementation of Nintendo's multimedia library (the `movie::` API of the SDK, a port of Android's stagefright) on Windows
// Media Foundation. The game imports 41 functions of the library (Extractor, Decoder, MediaData, Buffer, a few free functions); this
// module registers a host handler for each of them and forces the imports to the host (module_override_symbol), so the library that
// ships in subsdk0 (and the NVDEC/VIC driver calls under it) never runs.
//
//   [media] movie = mf (default) | off     off keeps the lifted subsdk0 library
//   [media] movie_log = 1                  one log line per decoder call (very verbose)
//
// Approach and protocol notes: smo-recomp runtime/services/nnmovie_mf.c (GPL-3.0). The game drives the library in a fixed way:
// an Extractor demuxes a movie file the game reads through its own ClientStreamReader, two Decoders (H.264 video as NV12, AAC audio
// as 16-bit PCM) turn the compressed samples into frames. Here the source reader of Media Foundation does the demuxing and the
// decoding in a worker thread; the "compressed sample" the extractor hands to a decoder is a token that stands for a decoded sample.
// The decoded NV12 frames and PCM blocks are copied into the buffers the game owns.
