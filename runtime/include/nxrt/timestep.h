// Frame time for the game's step (S11, docs/S11.md): a retail game that runs one tick of a hard-coded 1/60 s for every call of its
// frame update speeds up when it renders faster. This module measures the real time of each frame and feeds it to the game instead of the
// constant: the entry hook on the frame update computes the step, mid hooks load it into the registers that held the 1/60 immediates, and a
// few per-frame counters that are not driven by that dt (render timings, texture streaming, a per-tick friction, the background-work budget,
// the movie clock) are corrected. The mechanism is the game's own business only through Sites: the registered game (nxrt/game.h) lists
// where those places are (Metroid Prime Remastered: games/mpr/mpr_sites.h, the same addresses as recomp/games/mpr/main.sites).
//
// Configuration, section [time] (env NXRT_TIME_<KEY>):
//   mode = real | fixed | off     real (default): the step is the measured frame time, clamped and smoothed.
//                                 fixed: the step is 1/rate and the frame is held until that time has passed (the 60 Hz lock).
//                                 off: the game's own 1/60 per call (retail behaviour, nothing is touched).
//   rate = 60                     steps per second in fixed mode
//   off_rate = 0                  off mode only: hold the frame to this rate but keep the retail 1/60 step (a diagnostic: the game then runs rate/60 times faster)
//   max_rate = 480                real mode: the step is never shorter than 1/max_rate; with pace=1 a frame is held until then
//   min_rate = 30                 real mode: the step is never longer than 1/min_rate (a slower frame makes the game run slow)
//   smooth = 4                    real mode: the step is the mean of the last N frame times (1 = raw); a jump of more than 50 % restarts it
//   pace = 1                      hold the frame until the minimum step has passed (stops an uncapped limiter from running the game faster)
//   movie_real = 1                the movie list's clock is real elapsed time (audio plays in real time), not the step
//   fix_friction = 1              per-tick float constants (Load::ScaledFloat; Metroid: the in-air walk friction, 3.5 per 1/60 s) scaled by the step
//   fix_render_timings = 1        the render-timing clock (Sites::tick_render_timings) advances by the step (texture scroll, UV animation, water)
//   fix_streaming = 1             texture streaming ages its entries by the step instead of 1/60
//   fix_budget = 1                the background-work budget after the tick (Metroid: 14 ms) scales with the step
//   fix_stuck_tracker = 1         a per-tick sampler (Sites::per_tick_sampler; Metroid: the player's "am I stuck" test, 20 samples, one per tick) takes one sample
//                                 per 1/60 s of game time, so its window keeps its length at more than 60 ticks per second.
//   log_every = 0                 log one line of frame statistics every N frames (0 = off)
//   csv = <file>                  write one line per frame: frame, host time (s), measured elapsed, step used, sum of steps, movie frames delivered, render-timing clock
//   game_base = 0x7100000000      guest address of the main module
// Deterministic test mode ([test] deterministic=1): the step is [test] clock_step_ticks / 19.2 MHz (default 1/60 s) and nothing waits,
// so a scripted run at 60, 120, 144 or 240 steps per second is the same run with another clock_step_ticks (160000 = 120 Hz).
