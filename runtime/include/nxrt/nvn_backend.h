// The NVN-on-Vulkan back end (S4d). install_backend() replaces the logging stubs of the NVN shell (nvn.h) with real
// implementations and starts the render thread that replays the game's command lists on a gfx::Device.
//   * Memory pools are the game's own memory: the back end imports it as Vulkan memory (VK_EXT_external_memory_host), so a GPU
//     address is a host address and buffers are zero-copy.
//   * Game threads only record. nvnQueueSubmitCommands hands the lists to the render thread and returns when they are recorded
//     into Vulkan (not when the GPU has run them); fences, nvnQueueFinish and the memory a game polls follow the GPU timeline.
//   * nvnQueuePresentTexture draws the window texture into the Renderer's frame (honouring the shell's FrameLimiter when one is
//     given) and presents it.
// Configuration (config.h, environment wins): [nvn] shader_cache (translated SPIR-V folder), bc7_cache (ASTC->BC7 cache folder),
// bc7_quality, log_unimplemented; see docs/CONFIG.md.
