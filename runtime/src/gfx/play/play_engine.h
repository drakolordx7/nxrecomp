// Play mode: the binding engine. Keyboard keys, mouse buttons and wheel notches go in with timestamps; the Switch-pad contribution
// (buttons and stick deflection) comes out for any moment in time. No SDL, no game memory, no threads of its own: the caller supplies the
// clock, so the tests drive it with made-up times.
//
// Rules (docs/S8.md has the player-facing version):
//  * Bindings of the current context win over bindings of the `all` layer for the same input. `none` as the action switches the input off.
//  * Triggers: press = active while held. tap = a pulse of [timing] pulse_ms right after a release that came within the tap window.
//    hold = active while held, from the hold delay on. toggle = each press flips it. doubletap = active while held when the press came
//    within the window after the previous release of the same input. A mouse wheel notch is a pulse for every trigger except toggle (which flips).
//  * Set A / set B selects (mpr: beams / visors) and the wheel cycling are edge actions: when the binding becomes active the select output is
//    pressed for pulse_ms, however long the key stays down. SetANext / SetAPrev walk the tracked set-A member (the last one selected through
//    the engine or told by set_cycle_hint) over the members in the hint mask.
//  * Changing the context consumes every held input whose bindings differ in the new context: it does nothing until it is released.
//  * Stick contributions are summed per stick and normalised to length 1 (W + D is a diagonal, not 1.41).
