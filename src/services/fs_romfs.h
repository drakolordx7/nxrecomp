// A RomFS image synthesised from a host folder: the byte-addressed storage nn::fs::MountRom reads (fsp-srv OpenDataStorageByCurrentProcess
// returns it as an IStorage; the SDK parses the RomFS tables itself). Nothing is copied: the metadata tables are built in memory and
// file data is read from the host files on demand.
//
// Image layout (https://switchbrew.org/wiki/RomFS, libnx romfs_dev / yuzu fsmitm_romfsbuild): the 0x50-byte header at offset 0 (padded
// to 0x200), the file data partition from 0x200 (each file starts at a multiple of 0x10 from the partition start, in the order of the
// file table), then the directory hash table, directory table, file hash table and file table, each 4-byte aligned; the header holds
// the offsets and sizes. Entries are sorted by name (byte order) within a directory.
