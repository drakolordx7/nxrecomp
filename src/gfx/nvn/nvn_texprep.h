// Background preparation of texture upload data (stream S21). prepare_texture (nvn_texdata.cpp) reads the texture's storage in the game's
// memory, hashes it, reads the BC7 cache file and untiles; on the render thread, at an area load, that is a few dozen textures in one frame, and a
// few huge sparse volumes (23 and 46 MB each) that take 15 to 60 ms apiece. This module runs the same function on worker threads before the
// texture is first used and hands the result to tex_ensure_current.
//
// When a job starts (only block-compressed textures, the game's assets; render targets and video planes are not candidates):
//   * a handle of the texture is bound in a command list being recorded (nvnCommandBufferBindTexture*), which is shortly before the list is submitted;
//   * the texture is registered in a texture pool and has at least [nvn] tex_prep_early_kb of storage (the big ones are registered long before use);
//   * a sparse texture that was named by one of the above is written again (tile maps and tile writes arrive in many small steps): the job starts
//     when the writes have stopped for 40 ms.
// The game gives no signal when it has finished writing a texture (96% of the textures see no flush at all), so nothing here assumes the data is final.
//
// Correctness. A result is used only when both of these hold when the texture is first used:
//   * no CPU write was reported since the job started (Texture::prep_gen, bumped by every flush of pool memory, texel write and tile remap);
//   * the storage still hashes to what it hashed to before and after the job (so a write nobody reported cannot slip in; for a sparse texture the
//     hash covers the mapped tiles and where they sit).
// Otherwise the render thread prepares the texture itself exactly as before. A job still running for the texture is waited for, so a texture is
// never drawn with data that is not ready and never with older data than the synchronous path would have used. Jobs never transcode (an ASTC texture
// without a cache entry is left to the render thread), never run on a texture the game finalized, and are guarded against a page that disappears.
//
// Settings: [nvn] tex_prep (default on), tex_prep_threads, tex_prep_mb (budget of finished results held at once), tex_prep_min_kb,
// tex_prep_early_kb, tex_prep_verify (test aid: every used result is compared with a fresh preparation), tex_prep_log. Implementation:
// nvn_texprep.cpp; tests: gfx_nvn_texgpu.texprep_background_upload.
