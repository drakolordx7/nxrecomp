// Play mode self-test: a tiny scripted driver for the window, used by the oracles (tools/test/suites/play.toml). It is switched on by
// [play] selftest = "<step>,<step>,..." (environment NXRT_PLAY_SELFTEST) and runs one step per game frame boundary, on the main thread, through
// the same paths a person would use: SDL window calls and real SDL events pushed into SDL's queue (so they come back out of the pump).
//
//   wait:N                 wait N frames
//   size:WxH               SDL_SetWindowSize; the next steps see the resize event
//   mode:windowed|borderless|exclusive    platform::set_fullscreen
//   altenter               Alt+Enter as four SDL key events (the fullscreen toggle of play mode)
//   key:<name>:down|up     one SDL key event by scancode name, e.g. key:Return:down
//   close                  SDL_EVENT_QUIT (the close button): play mode ends the process with exit code 0
//   cap:N                  frame cap N fps (0 = unlimited) on the limiter, then the measurement window restarts
//   measure:S              wait S seconds of wall time, then log "selftest: fps=<presents per second>" for the cap in force
//   expect_mode:X          fail unless the window is in mode X
//   expect_size:WxH        fail unless the window client size is exactly W x H pixels
//   expect_fps:N:TOL       fail unless the last measure was within TOL (fraction, e.g. 0.03) of N fps
//   expect_late:MS         fail unless the frames that waited in the last measure started within MS (p99) of their scheduled time
//   set:<key>=<value>      change a setting the way the settings page does (queued, applied at the next frame, written to the settings file):
//                          vsync (0/1), fps_cap, window_mode, yaw_source, pitch_source, invert_y, invert_x, prompt_style (switch xbox playstation
//                          keyboard auto: the Button prompts combo of the Controller tab)
//   expect_present:X       fail unless the swapchain presents with mode X (fifo, mailbox, immediate)
//   expect_cap:N           fail unless the frame limiter's target is N fps
//   expect_ini:TEXT        fail unless the settings file contains TEXT
//   gate:NAME              hold the script until a file selftest_NAME exists in the working folder (it is deleted, then the script goes on)
//   report[:label]         log one line: window mode, pixel size, focus, minimised, refresh rate, frames
//   pass                   exit code 0 now ("selftest PASS" in the log); without it the process keeps running after the last step
// A failed expectation logs "selftest FAIL: <why>" and ends the process with exit code 1. Every step is logged ("selftest: step n: ...").
