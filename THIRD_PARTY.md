# Third-party code in recomp/

nxrecomp is GPL-3.0-or-later (see `LICENSE`). It is built from the projects below. Every borrowed file carries a header
naming its source; this page lists them with the exact upstream commit that was read.

| Source (commit) | Licence | What was taken | Where it is now |
|---|---|---|---|
| smo-recomp `f88beab36ba39a29f574a9c97ee28b052e96104b` | GPL-3.0-or-later | the instruction translator (class `Fn`), function discovery, program-level lift, NSO reading, the Unicorn differential test and its host program, the mutation-test idea, `fpexact.h` (exact FP helpers), `neon.h` (SIMD helpers), the context struct and flag helpers (`runtime.h`), the optnone / time-limit build rule (`build_main.py`) | `nxrecomp/lift/a64.py`, `nxrecomp/program.py`, `nxrecomp/funcs.py`, `nxrecomp/nso.py`, `nxrecomp/image.py` (loader part), `include/nxrecomp/ctx.h`, `fpexact.h`, `neon.h`, `oracle/difftest/{difftest.py,host.cpp,mutation.py}`, `cmake/nx_cc_launcher.py` |
| SuperMarioWonderRecomp `665b2f9c175be3386cb0f683b677aa443afbbf06` | MIT (notice below) | the Capstone-driven emitters for newer-SDK instruction coverage (LSE atomics, LDXP/STXP, crypto AES/SHA/PMULL, scalar AdvSIMD forms, pairwise / across-lane / long forms), the C++ helper header, the jump-table resolver | `nxrecomp/lift/tier2/*.py` (ported emitters, kept as the base), `include/nxrecomp/cxx.h` (helpers), `nxrecomp/jumptables.py` |
| ssbu-recomp `fea28c18b785372b5024ece0a2ea52e860b1fa04` | GPL-3.0 | C++ exception lifting with landing-pad resume entries and `nro_catch_call` (here `nx_catch_call`), the site list (patch / inline / midhook / dynimm / noinline / jtable) of `relift_sites.py`, the hook-table / noinline rule of `hook_inline_check.py` | `nxrecomp/program.py` (`u_<entry>`, resume table, `load_sites`), `include/nxrecomp/ctx.h` (`NxResume`, `nx_catch_call`) |
| ScarletNX `9ec73af7fe2712e8f823f399640ca3e71d3baff6` | GPL-3.0-or-later | TPIDR_EL0 / TPIDRRO_EL0 kept apart; Cortex-A57 as the Unicorn reference; the audit corpus's edge-value design; the known-answer cases (`tests/a64_ported_cases.h`, originally rEden / dynarmic tests) are read from `refs/` by `oracle/ka/run_ka.py`, not copied | `ctx.h` (`tpidrro`), `oracle/difftest/common.py`, `oracle/ka/` |

Not taken: smo-recomp's `sdklift.py` / `sdklift_rules.txt`, `gen_tables.py` (SMO symbol matching between the base game and the
update, nerve naming), `extract.py` (SMO version / NPDM checks), its clang-9 build scripts, and everything under its `runtime/`
except the three headers above. The game-specific seam is `games/<name>/config.py`.
